        <h1>A Little RegEx, A Little Node, A Lot of Time Saved</h1>
        <h2>File Parser</h2>
        <p>In October of 2017 I found myself ready to bang my head against a wall. For my job, I was continuously migrating websites into a newer drupal theme and found myself manually scrubbing bad HTML and CSS for <strong>hundreds</strong> of pages to ensure that the new sites had a clean code base. I had to make links relative, remove inline styles, add bootstrap classes to tables and so much more. Can you say no thanks?</p>
        <p>I had recently learned RegEx and had taken a course where I got to play around with node.js and npm. I thought that perhaps I could use these technologies to build a solution to automate this repetitive, time consuming task.</p>
        <p>After three days of research, trial and error I came up with a solution that allowed me to take an xml feed from the original site, run it through my script to create a new xml file stripped of bad code, which I could take and import into the new site.</p>
        <p>Voila... hundreds of future hours saved from doing unnecessary manual work.  Check it out at my GitHub below!</p>
